my first pet project
==============

This project is planned to impart a working knowledge of Supervised classification, Regression. In this pet-project I used the most popular Enron dataset. I also got hands on with the text classification with the email classification. I mainly dealt with the scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib. You can encounter some interesting topics/libraries in this project some of them are:   
- Supervised Classification
      
      - Naive Bayes
      
      - Support Vector Machines
      
      - Decision Trees
      * kNN (k-nearest neighbors)
      * AdaBoost
      * Random forests
- Regression
      * Linear regression
- Outliers
      * Outlier detection
      * Removal of outliers
- Clusterin
- Text Classificationg
- Pickle (to interpret and write a file in the very accessible means)
- Testing a model and coming up with the accuracy score of the model
